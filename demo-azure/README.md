# Deploy a Vulnerable Web App for WAAS testing

This Terraform helps you to deploy a vulnerable web app (bWAPP) to test WAAS Protection with Prisma Cloud on Azure.

bWAPP, or a buggy web application, is a free and open source deliberately insecure web application.
It helps security enthusiasts, developers and students to discover and to prevent web vulnerabilities. More info in [bWAPP project](http://www.itsecgames.com/)

### Pre-requisites ðŸ“‹

1. You have to login to your Azure Portal account and upload the Terraform file into your Cloud Shell, or you can use your local machine. You must have `terraform` and `az cli` installed.

2. You have to udpate the Terraform variables.

	_prefix = <AZURE_LOCATION>_
		default = "eastus"

	_prefix = <JUST_A_NAME_FOR_YOUR_APP>_
		default = "my-vulnerable-app"

	_mgt_address = <CIDR_TO_MGT_THE_VM>_
		default = "0.0.0.0/0"
	
	_app_address = <CIDR_TO_ACCESS_TO_THE_APP>_
		default = "0.0.0.0/0"
	
	Feel free to update all your VM params if you want.

### How to deploy the bWAPP:

```
terraform init
```

```
terraform apply
```

If deploy is successful, you gonna see the public_ip from terraform outputs to access to the app.

Also, you can access to the VM via SSH to install your Container Defender.

### How to setup bWAPP:

You can access to bWAPP from: http://<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>/install.php and then click on "Click here to install bWAPP".

If successful now can go to Login (bee/bug).

Here you can find some common attacks to test:

[SQL Injection](https://infosecgirls.gitbook.io/infosecgirls-training/v/appsec/web-application-pentesting/injection/time-based-sql-injection)

[Broken Authentication](https://infosecgirls.gitbook.io/infosecgirls-training/v/appsec/web-application-pentesting/a2-broken-authentication-and-session/broken-authentication-with-bwapp)

### Cleaning Up

```
terraform destroy
```
